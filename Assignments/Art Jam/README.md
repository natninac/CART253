## Description

This program was created using p5 and javascript. The cursor is the main tool to navigate the page, as traveling on the X axis changes the color and size of the sun, and traveling on the Y axis makes it shake at a higher intensity. The words shown at the bottom are common vocabulary from right-wing climate denialist platforms and politicians. The final piece is supposed to draw a parallel between our current climate crisis and a potential sun death crisis.

## Credits
