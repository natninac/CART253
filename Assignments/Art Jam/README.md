## Description

This program was created using p5 and javascript. The cursor is the main tool to navigate the page, as traveling on the X-axis changes the color and size of the sun, and traveling on the Y-axis makes it shake at a higher intensity. The words at the bottom are commonly used phrases and terms surrounding modern climate change debates, especially on the denialist side. When the mouse is pressed, "Fitter Happier" by Radiohead plays. The song and words are meant to satirize the discourse and distractions happening around environmental crises (in this case, an explosion of the sun).

## Credits

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

I used ChatGPT to find words. I also used various quotes from politicians and articles to compile words.

Tutorials from p5.js and Pippin Barr were used to write the code.

## Attribution

Some random words were taken using ChatGPT.

https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/ was the tutorial I used to build the background

https://editor.p5js.org/monicawen/sketches/Sysfh-Hsm I used this sketch to help code the song inclusion

https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/variables/challenges/variables-challenges.html I used the Mr Furious tutorial to write the sun shaking code

https://p5js.org/tutorials/conditionals-and-interactivity/ I used this tutorial to change the colors of the sun and background with conditionals based on where the mouse is on the canvas.
