[Play it!](https://natninac.github.io/CART253/Assignments/Mod Jam/radiationFrog)


## Description

A game about a hungry frog in a radiation-contaminated world just trying to survive and avoid getting poisoned. 

The user must try to eat as many black flies while avoiding to eat the green ones, which are contaminated with radiation. As the health of the frog depletes, its skin turns darker and a third eye appears. Once its health is down to zero, a screen appears to announce that you have died... Of radiation poisoning!
