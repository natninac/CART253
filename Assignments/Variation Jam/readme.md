## Description

This experience is meant to highlight moral issues relating to capital punishment by using elements of psychological horror. The game starts as a normal hangman game and progresses into guessing names of exonerated death row inmates, and the player is confronted with the reality of the American death penalty. The final part of the game is a cycle that the player can't get out of, as they are missing a small piece to innocence. Instead, they can simply be found guilty.
